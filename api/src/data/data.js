The system is built with React, Redux-Toolkit and Typescript on the front end. It allows users to define the steps required to return to service after any of the above senarios take place. \n\nIt also allows users to create a curated list of all the requirements to run their service, such as staffing levels, medical equipment and access to other systems. The system can then alert users if any of the supplies are close to falling below minium acceptable levels."

I am social and find it easy to work within a motivated team looking to grow and develop a product, I value other people's viewpoints and try to consider all angles before making decisions. I enjoy learning new skills and regularly teach myself using resources like PluralSight. I am proactive by nature and try to push forward and resolve problems when they present themselves. \n\nIf I were to get the job I hope to hit the ground running and help the team to push for collective goals. On a personal level I'm always looking to improve my skills, have fun and push myself to climb the career ladder and take on more responsibility for big picture technical choices."
